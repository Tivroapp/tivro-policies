        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Effective date: February 17, 2026</p>

        <div class="summary">
            <strong>Summary:</strong> Tivro stores all your data locally on your device. We do not collect, transmit, or store your personal information on any server. We do not use analytics, advertising, or tracking SDKs.
        </div>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Tivro ("we", "us", or "our") handles information when you use the Tivro mobile application (the "App"). By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this policy.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> When you create an account within the App, you may provide a display name and email address. This information is stored locally on your device using Apple's UserDefaults. It is not transmitted to any external server.</p>
        <p><strong>Learning Progress:</strong> Your study progress, including mastered words, streak data, scores, word points, pinned words, and preferences, is stored locally on your device. This data never leaves your device.</p>
        <p><strong>Subscription Information:</strong> If you purchase a Tivro Pro subscription, the transaction is processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not collect, process, or have access to your payment information, credit card details, or billing address.</p>

        <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
        <p>Tivro does not collect or have access to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Location data (GPS, IP-based, or otherwise)</li>
            <li>Device identifiers (IDFA, IDFV, or similar)</li>
            <li>Contacts, photos, camera, or microphone data</li>
            <li>Browsing history or usage analytics</li>
            <li>Cookies, web beacons, or tracking pixels</li>
            <li>Health, financial, or biometric data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not integrate any third-party analytics services (such as Firebase, Google Analytics, or Mixpanel), advertising networks, or tracking SDKs of any kind.</p>

        <h2>3. How Your Data Is Stored</h2>
        <p>All user data is stored locally on your device using Apple's built-in on-device storage (UserDefaults). No data is uploaded to cloud services, external databases, or remote servers. Your data remains entirely under your control on your device.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell, rent, trade, or otherwise share your personal information with any third parties. Since all data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to us, we have no user data to share.</p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Apple App Store:</strong> If you purchase a subscription, Apple processes your payment and manages your subscription. Apple's handling of your data is governed by <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/">Apple's Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
        <p><strong>Text-to-Speech:</strong> Tivro uses Apple's built-in text-to-speech engine (AVSpeechSynthesizer) to pronounce Chinese words and sentences. All speech processing occurs entirely on your device. No audio data or text is sent to external servers.</p>
        <p>We do not integrate any other third-party services, SDKs, or APIs.</p>

        <h2>6. Tracking and Advertising</h2>
        <p>Tivro does not track you. We do not use the Apple Advertising Identifier (IDFA), and we do not track users across apps or websites owned by other companies. Tivro contains no advertisements and no advertising SDKs.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Tivro is an educational language-learning app suitable for users of all ages. We comply with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the UK Age Appropriate Design Code, and equivalent regulations in other jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 (or the applicable minimum age in your jurisdiction). Since all data is stored locally on the device and is never transmitted to us, no personal information from any user — including children — is collected or processed by Tivro.</p>
        <p>If you are a parent or guardian and have concerns, please contact us at the email address listed below.</p>

        <h2>8. Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
        <p>Since all data is stored on your device, you have full control over your data at all times. You can delete all data associated with Tivro by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Using the "Sign Out" feature within the App to clear your account data</li>
            <li>Deleting the App from your device, which removes all locally stored data</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We do not retain any user data on external servers, so there is no additional data to request deletion of.</p>

        <h2>9. Your Rights Under Applicable Law</h2>
        <p>Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal data under laws such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>UK GDPR / EU GDPR:</strong> Right to access, rectify, erase, restrict processing, data portability, and object to processing</li>
            <li><strong>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA):</strong> Right to know, delete, and opt out of the sale of personal information</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Since Tivro does not collect, store, or process your personal data on any server, these rights are inherently fulfilled — your data remains on your device and under your exclusive control at all times. We do not sell personal information.</p>

        <h2>10. International Users</h2>
        <p>Tivro is available to users worldwide. Since we do not transfer any data off your device, there are no international or cross-border data transfers to disclose.</p>

        <h2>11. Security</h2>
        <p>Your data is protected by the security features built into your Apple device, including device encryption, passcode protection, and Face ID or Touch ID. Since we do not transmit or store data externally, there is no risk of server-side data breaches from Tivro.</p>

        <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or for legal, regulatory, or operational reasons. If we make material changes, we will update the "Effective date" at the top of this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.</p>
