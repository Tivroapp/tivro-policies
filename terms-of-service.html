        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>You may use Tivro if you are at least 4 years of age (or the minimum age required by Apple for app downloads in your jurisdiction). If you are under 18, you represent that your parent or legal guardian has reviewed and agreed to these Terms on your behalf.</p>

        <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>

        <h2>4. Free and Paid Features</h2>
        <p>Tivro is free to download and use. The free version provides access to core learning features. Certain premium features may be available through an optional paid subscription ("Tivro Pro").</p>
